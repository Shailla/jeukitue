GLIntercept Manual install
-------------------------------

If you are unable to use the installers provided for GLIntercept, 
(eg. you do not have install permissions or the install fails) 
you can perform a manual install.

Simply extract the archive and update any gliConfig*.ini files you
 want to use with the new path. 
(eg. search and replace all the references to "C:\Program Files" with the new location)

NOTE: GLIntercept does NOT make use of the registry, so you can use it on a USB key etc.
